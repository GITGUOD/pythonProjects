#One random-object that is supposed to be used for the bot as a way to randomize the pick between rock,papper and scissor 
#And finally one object, some sort of scanner-object that the player can choose between scissor, rock and paper

#Before
#s = "Scissor" 
#r = "Rock"
#p = "paper"

#A array to store the string objects
